* KSChannel: Baseline model assuming knowledge sharing is "opening channels" for knowledge transfer
  * KSCost: A variant model with knowledge transfer cost parameter (limiting the number of knowledge transfer one can be involved in each time period)
* KSDyadic: Baseline model assuming knowledge sharing is giving knowledge to another (opposite of knowledge seeking)
